- matplotlib : to plot tarin and test result

Data set contains values to predict the type of breast cancer- Malignant or Benign

dependent value is Diagnosis, which is learned during the training.

A keras model is created with 4 layers

since it is a binary classification, Sigmoid activation function and binary\_crossentropy loss function used.

Loss  = 0.0831

Accuracy = 0.9845
